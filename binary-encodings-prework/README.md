# Binary Representation of Data

## Hexadecimal
### Simple conversion
#### What are the numbers 9, 136 and 247 in hexadecimal?

1. 9 is decimal is **9 in hex**

1. 136 in decimal is: 

    136 / 16 = 8
    136 % 16 = 8

    **88 in hex**

1. 247 in decimal is:

    247 / 16 = 15 => f
    247 % 16 = 7

    **f7 in hex**

#### In CSS, two ways to specify colors are hexadecimal and rgb. For instance, pure red would be 0xff0000 or rgb(255, 0, 0);. How many colors can be represented in each form?

hexidemicals at order of 2 can represent 16 ^ 2 different combinations, which is 255 + 1 (for zero), the same as rgba.

So each can reprensent 256^3 colors == **16,777,216**

#### 17 bytes is how many hexidecimal characters

Theres are 8 bits in every byte => 2 hex characters in every byte (2 (bits) ^4 == 16 ) => **2 * 17 characters => 34**

#### Convert the first 5 bytes in the file by hand to binary. Write these down as youâ€™ll use them again in a later exercise

68|65|6c|6c|6f = 0110100001100101011011000110110001101111




## Integers
### Basic conversion

1. 4 in decimal is **100 in binary**

1. 65 in decimal is 

    2^6 (64) + 2^0 = 65

    **1000001**

1. 105 in decimal is 

    2^6 (64) + 2^5 (32) + 2^3 (8) + 2^0  (1)

    **1101001**

1. 255 in decimal is 

    2^8 - 1

    2^2 - 1 = 3 right, which is expressed as 11 (or 2 "1"s), so
    2^8 - 1 will be expressed as 8 "1"s

    **11111111**

1. 10 in binary is

    2 in decimal

1. 11 in binary is

    is 3 in decimal

1. 1101100

   2^6 (64) + 2^5 (32) + 2^2 (8) + 4

   108

1.  1010101

    2^7 (64) + 16 + 4 + 1

    85
